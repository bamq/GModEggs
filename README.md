# GModEggs
A simple text chat-based easter eggs sytem for Garry's Mod.

## Features:
* The system checks if a player has entered one of the pre-determined easter eggs in chat. If the string matches an easter egg, the player will be notified that they discovered an easter egg and, if enabled, will be rewarded PointShop points (requires PointShop to be installed). You can also configure how many points are awarded.
* Add as many easter eggs as you want. All of the configuration options are located in the sh_eggs_config.lua file. References to your community and inside jokes make good easter eggs!
* Ability to disable the discovery of easter eggs during TTT rounds. We found that sometimes people spend more time guessing easter eggs instead of playing the game, so this option was added. Players may still discover them during rounds if they are dead or spectating, however.
* Should work with all gamemodes.

## Installation:
* Download the latest release from the release page.
* Extract to your addons folder on the server.
* Restart your server.

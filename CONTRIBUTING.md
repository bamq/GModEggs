# Contributing to GModEggs
Please feel free create pull requests and report issues or make suggestions. However, I do ask you to consider the following.

## Code formatting

Please keep your code formatting consistent with the rest of the addon:
* UpperCamelCase for functions.
* lowerCamelCase for variables.
* Consistent use of whitespace.
* Use tabs for indentation-- no spaces, with a tab size of 4 spaces.
* None or as little C-style GMod Lua as possible (`~=` instead of `!=`, `and` instead of `&&`, `or` instead of `||`, etc.)

## Reporting issues and making suggestions

You may post any suggestions or bugs you find under [Issues](https://github.com/bamq/GModEggs/issues), but please be as descriptive as possible.
